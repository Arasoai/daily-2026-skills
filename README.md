# Trending Skills

Auto-generated agent skills from GitHub's trending open source projects, by [ara.so](https://ara.so).

Every 15 minutes, a GitHub Actions workflow checks what's trending on GitHub and creates a comprehensive agent skill for the top project. Skills are published to [skills.sh](https://skills.sh/Aradotso/trending-skills) and installable by any AI coding agent.

## Install all skills

```bash
npx skills add Aradotso/trending-skills
```

## Install a specific skill

```bash
npx skills add Aradotso/trending-skills --skill lightpanda-browser
```

## How it works

1. GitHub Actions cron runs every 15 minutes
2. Fetches the hottest new repos (created in the last 7 days, sorted by stars)
3. Skips repos that already have a skill
4. Uses Claude Sonnet 4.6 to generate a comprehensive SKILL.md from the repo's README
5. Commits, pushes, and registers on skills.sh
